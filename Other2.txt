Hi Finance Team,

Following our recent review of departmental spending, I’d like to formally request a reallocation of $12,000 from the training budget (Account 604) to the equipment maintenance budget (Account 411) for Q3.

We’ve had an unexpected increase in service requirements for medical scanners, and without this adjustment, we may exceed our current threshold.

Please confirm if this reallocation can be processed by next Friday, August 29.

Best regards,  
Carla Mendez  
Senior Operations Manager  
NorthPoint Health Systems
